# Finite-Time-Trajectory-Tracking-of-Mecanum-Wheel-Mobile-Robot
This repository presents the implementation and results of the research work "Finite time trajectory tracking of a mecanum wheel mobile robot, which was published in International Journal of system science. 
The project focuses on the design and validation of a finite-time control law for trajectory tracking and stabilization of a four-wheel omnidirectional (Mecanum) mobile robot.

The proposed controller ensures finite-time convergence of position and velocity errors, improving robustness and transient performance compared to classical asymptotic methods.
