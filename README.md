## 📌 Overview

This work proposes a **finite-time backstepping control framework** for accurate trajectory tracking of a four-wheeled mecanum robot (FWMR). The controller ensures:

- ✅ Global uniform finite-time stability
- ✅ Uniform continuity and boundedness of control law
- ✅ Explicit convergence-time computation
- ✅ Robustness under bounded disturbances
- ✅ Reduced control effort compared with asymptotic control
- ✅ Hardware validation beyond simulation
